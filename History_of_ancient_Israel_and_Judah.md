## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of ancient Israel and Judah spans from 
> the early appearance of the Israelites in Canaan's hill country 
> during the late second millennium BCE, 
> to the establishment and subsequent downfall of the two Israelite kingdoms 
> in the mid-first millennium BCE. 
> 
> This history unfolds within the Southern Levant during the Iron Age. 
> The earliest documented mention of "Israel" as a people appears on the Merneptah Stele, 
> an ancient Egyptian inscription dating back to around 1208 BCE. 
> Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient Israelite culture 
> evolved from the pre-existing Canaanite civilization. 
> 
> During the Iron Age II period, two Israelite kingdoms emerged, covering much of Canaan: 
> - the Kingdom of Israel in the north and 
> - the Kingdom of Judah in the south.
>
> According to the Hebrew Bible, a "United Monarchy" consisting of Israel and Judah 
> existed as early as the 11th century BCE, under the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon; 
> the great kingdom later was separated into two smaller kingdoms: 
> - Israel, containing the cities of Shechem and Samaria, in the north, 
> - and Judah, containing Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple, in the south. 
> 
> The historicity of the United Monarchy is debated—
> as there are no archaeological remains of it that are accepted as consensus—
> but historians and archaeologists agree that Israel and Judah existed as separate kingdoms by c. 900 BCE and c. 850 BCE, respectively. The kingdoms' history is known in greater detail than that of other kingdoms in the Levant, primarily due to the selective narratives in the Books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, which were included in the Bible.
>
> The northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. While the Kingdom of Judah remained intact during this time, it became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire. However, Jewish revolts against the Babylonians led to the destruction of Judah in 586 BCE, under the rule of Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. According to the biblical account, the armies of Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem between 589 and 586 BCE, which led to the destruction of Solomon's Temple and the exile of the Jews to Babylon; this event was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles. The exilic period saw the development of the Israelite religion towards a monotheistic Judaism.
>
> The exile ended with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire c. 538 BCE. Subsequently, the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great issued a proclamation known as the Edict of Cyrus, which authorized and encouraged exiled Jews to return to Judah. Cyrus' proclamation began the exiles' return to Zion, inaugurating the formative period in which a more distinctive Jewish identity developed in the Persian province of Yehud. During this time, the destroyed Solomon's Temple was replaced by the Second Temple, marking the beginning of the Second Temple period.
