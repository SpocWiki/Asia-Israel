> Golda Meir (previously Meyerson; née Mabovitch; 3 May 1898 – 8 December 1978) 
> was the prime minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974. 
> She was Israel's first and, to date, only female head of government. 
>
> Born into a Jewish family in Kiev (within present-day Ukraine), Russian Empire, 
> Meir immigrated with her family to the United States in 1906. 
> She graduated from the Milwaukee State Normal School and found work as a teacher. 
> While in Milwaukee, she embraced the Labor Zionist movement. 
> 
> In 1921, Meir and her husband immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, 
> settling in Merhavia, later becoming the kibbutz's representative to the Histadrut. 
> In 1934, she was elevated to the executive committee of the trade union. 
> 
> Meir held several key roles in the Jewish Agency during and after World War II. 
> She was a signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, in 1948. 
> Meir was elected to the Knesset, in 1949, and served as Labor Minister until 1956, 
> when she was appointed Foreign Minister by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. 
> She retired from the ministry in 1966 due to ill health.
>
> In 1969, Meir assumed the role of prime minister following the death of Levi Eshkol. 
> Early in her tenure, she made multiple diplomatic visits to western leaders 
> to promote her vision of peace in the region. 
> The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 caught Israel off guard 
> and inflicted severe early losses on the army. 
> 
> The resulting public anger damaged Meir's reputation and led to an inquiry into the failings. 
> Her Alignment coalition was denied a majority in the subsequent legislative election; 
> she resigned the following year and was succeeded as prime minister by Yitzhak Rabin. 
> Meir died in 1978 of lymphoma and was buried on Mount Herzl.
>
> A controversial figure in Israel, Meir has been lionized as a founder of the state 
> and described as the "Iron Lady" of Israeli politics, 
> but also widely blamed for the country being caught by surprise during the war of 1973. 
> In addition, her dismissive statements towards the Palestinians 
> have been described as the most famous example of Israeli denial of Palestinian identity. 
> Most historians believe Meir was more successful as Minister of Labour and Housing than as Premier.
