> The Jerusalem District (Hebrew: מחוז ירושלים; Arabic: منطقة القدس) 
> is one of the six administrative districts of Israel. The district capital is Jerusalem and its total land area is 652 km2. The population of 1,159,900 is 66.3% Jewish and 32.1% Arab. A fifth (21%) of the Arabs in Israel live in the Jerusalem Municipality, which includes both East and West Jerusalem. Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem has not been recognized by the international community.
>
> Most Arabs in the Jerusalem District are Palestinians, eligible to apply for citizenship under Israeli law, but either decline to apply or are unsuccessful in doing so. Arab citizens of Israel constitute a significant minority in the district, living in Abu Ghosh, Beit Safafa and East Jerusalem, where Arab professionals have settled since the late 1970s, mainly for the provision of legal and other services to the local population. The non-Jewish population is 95.2% Muslim, 3.5% Christian with the others unclassified by religion.
